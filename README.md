# Keypad_controlled_gate
Keypad controlled gate with proximity sensors and DC motor. 

Implemented using Arduino Uno reading data from the laptop keypad using the serial monitor.

Beginner level Arduino project that demonstrates the interfacing of H-Bridge module which controls the DC motors and proximity sensors.

Also demonstrates how function calls can help eliminate repetition of code and improve efficiency.
